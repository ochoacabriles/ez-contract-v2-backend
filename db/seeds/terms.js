Your receipt of the Order Confirmation only confirms that we have received your order; it does not constitute ez-contract&#39;s acceptance of your order or ez-contract&#39;s confirmation of our offer to sell. An order is not binding upon ez-contract until it is accepted; ez-contract must receive payment before it will accept an order. Payment for product(s) ordered is due prior todelivery or pick-up. Once payment is received and an order is accepted, ez-contract will issue an invoice to you and a contract will come into existence between you and us. ez-contract may, in its sole discretion, at any time after receiving your order, accept or decline your order for any reason. In addition, ez-contract may, in its sole discretion, cancel your order and limit order quantity. Where your order is declined, cancelled or limited, we will inform you of this by appropriate means and you will not be charged. If however, your order is limited or canceled after your credit card has been charged for the purchase, ez-contract will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.
